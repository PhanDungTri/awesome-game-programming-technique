- [Handling Terrain Transitions](https://www.gamedev.net/tutorials/_/technical/game-programming/tilemap-based-game-techniques-handling-terrai-r934/): this article discuss a method for handling terrain transitions on the tile map display, which smoothens the game world and makes the map look more natural, thus brings better experience for players.

- [Generate Random Cave Levels Using Cellular Automata](https://gamedevelopment.tutsplus.com/tutorials/generate-random-cave-levels-using-cellular-automata--gamedev-9664): look at a great method for generating random levels that can create new pieces of game content at any time - even when the game is running!.

- [Squares Made for Marching](https://www.omiod.com/docs/pdf/Squares-Made-for-Marching.pdf): an article examines procedural tile placement using the Marching Squares algorithm.

- [Understanding Steering Behaviors](https://gamedevelopment.tutsplus.com/series/understanding-steering-behaviors--gamedev-12732): steering behaviors aim to help autonomous characters move in a realistic manner, by using simple forces that are combined to produce life-like, improvisational navigation around the characters' environment.

- ["Wave Collapse Function" algorithm in Processing](https://discourse.processing.org/t/wave-collapse-function-algorithm-in-processing/12983): bitmap & tilemap generation from a single example with the help of ideas from quantum mechanics.
